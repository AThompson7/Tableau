Dashboard 1: In the first dashboard we can see the total number of rides in 2022 so far is just under 700,000. We can also see sharp growth with both membership holders and casual users up until July. As we would expect, the total ride length in hours also increases alongside the user growth; however, the average ride length is similar for each month. This indicates that season and temperature may not influence ride length.

Dashboard 2: In the second dashboard we can see a breakdown between summer and winter months. During the summer and winter months the most popular time for starting a ride was around 6pm and both had very similar profiles for starting ride time. This suggests that there may be other factors that have a greater influence on ride start time than season. For example, spikes at 8am and 6pm coincide with start and ending work times where people may use the bike services to travel.

Map: The map shows each station with the size of each marker corresponding to the number of rides started from that location. We can see that outside of a few outliers, the stations along the river are more popular. This is likely because the river is a popular location for recreational riders.
